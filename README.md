# miURL

miURL is a web application project developed with Python that allows users to create a custom, 
short URL and copy it to the clipboard of their device for pasting. Users can create
a URL that links to another website or a file. The application was designed and built with 
Pythonâ€™s Flask web framework, JSON, and clipboard.js.

## Installation

1. **Install Python 3**

    If not currently installed on your computer, download and install Python 3 at [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Download Project**

    Download a zip of the miURL project from GitHub or clone the repository.

3. **Create a Virtual Environment**

    It is best to locally run a Flask application using a virtual environment. To get setup with a virtual 
    environment, follow the quick [guide](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/installation/#installation) 
    on the Flask website, which has instructions for both Windows and Mac OS X. The guide will walk you through 
    how to create a virtual environement within the project directory and install Flask in the environment. 
    
    >> **Note:** The Flask guide uses the command line. If you are not familiar with terminal commands, read this 
    >> [blog](https://scotch.io/bar-talk/10-need-to-know-mac-terminal-commands) by scotch.io to learn 10 commonly
    >> used terminal commands - #10 is a fun one!

4. **Add File Path to *user_files* Directory**

    Last, you will need to add the absolute file path to the project's *user_files* directory. In addition to creating
    short URLs that link to other websites, miURL also allows users to upload and create URLs for PDF, PNG, JPEG, 
    JPG, or GIF files! In order for this feature to occur, a storage location is needed.

    Within the project, there is a *user_files* directory located in the *static* directory. The *user_files* 
    acts as a storage location for users' uploaded files. In deployment, this storage setup would be handled 
    differently. For the purpose of running this project locally, the *user_files* directory will store 
    any files uploaded to the miURL application.

    ### Instructions

    To add the file path, open the *app.py* Python file. On line 14 of the file, you should see the below code.
    For the `app.config['USER_FILES']` object, replace the file path string `'path/miurl/static/user_files/'` 
    with a string of your computer's absolute file path to the *user_files* directory. The *user_files* directory 
    is located in the project's *static* directory.

    ```python 
    app.config['USER_FILES'] = 'path/miurl/static/user_files/'
    ```

    If you are unfamiliar with how to get absolute file paths for directories, use the following links below.

    * [Windows](https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/articles/00015251)

    >> **Note**: Once making the above edit, be sure to save the *app.py* file.


## Usage

Next, you will need to run the miURL Flask application in your newly created virtual environment.
Use the command line to access the project directory and start the virtual environment. Once you have
enabled the virtual environment, you can now run the app to start a local server using the 
following command line syntax.

```
$ export FLASK_ENV=development
$ flask run
```

This step enables the development environment, including the interactive debugger and reloader, and then starts the server on `http://localhost:5000/`. Copy the server link from the command line, then place it in your browser to access the miURL web app. To view how to interact with the app and it's features, watch the demo below.
